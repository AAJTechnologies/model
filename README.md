# Nibiru Model
Nibiru Model is a set of classes for defining data [types](../../wiki/Types). Using these types, [values](../../wiki/Values) can be defined. Changes to such values are observable, allowing type-safe [binding](../../wiki/Bindings) creation.

The goal is to provide classes for building models (domain, presentation, etc.). There are other solutions for this problem, but this one aims to be a simple and portable approach.
